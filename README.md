# Bubla Engine
my first game engine with an interface and you can really make a game on it, but I don't really like the structure of the game engine, I think I should rewrite it in c++, otherwise everything in it is poorly optimized! 
you can also take a look at this repository(https://github.com/VadimAbergard/Framework-for-BublaEngine ), it goes in conjunction with this project
